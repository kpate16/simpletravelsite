        <label>History</label>
        <p>
          Pittsburgh was founded on November 27, 1758. The city was named by
          General John Forbes, in honor of British statesman William Pitt, the
          1st Earl of Chatham. Early on, Pittsburgh played an important role in
          our country’s history. In the early 1800s, the city became known as
          the “Gateway to the West.” This nickname referenced the huge advantage
          Pittsburgh had by having the intersection of three major waterways.
          The Allegheny River and Monongahela River join together at what is
          known as the “point” to form the Ohio River. This intersection opened
          the gates for Pittsburgh to lead the way in the trade industry for
          products such as coal, timber, glass, natural gas, iron and limestone.
          By 1911, Pittsburgh manufactured half of the nation’s steel. Due to
          the amount of pollution given off by the steel factories the city had
          a new nickname - “The Smoky City." Throughout the years, Pittsburgh
          has made multiple changes and overcome many obstacles. The city has
          moved from the steel industry to become a leader in healthcare,
          education, technology, and financial services. What were once heavily
          polluted streets and riverfronts, have been transformed to create the
          modern vibrant Pittsburgh one sees today.
